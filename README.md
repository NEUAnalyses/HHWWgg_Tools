# HH_WWgg
Di-Higgs->WW*gg analysis

As of 7 Februrary 2019, this repository is used for creating MINIAOD's from madgraph/pythia fragments. A new feature has also just been added for plotting gen level information. Another component of this analysis is a branch of [my forked repository of Flashgg](https://github.com/atishelmanch/flashgg/tree/HH_WWgg).
