# HIG-21-014 Post pre-approval talk checks 

The purpose of this directory is to keep track of macros and files used for performing the tasks required after the HIG-21-014 pre-approval talk. 

Very basic workflow without updating anything:

```
  python Combine_NLO.py
  <evaluate semileptonic DNN>
  python3 Compare_Hists.py
```
